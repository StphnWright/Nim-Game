Programming Project P6.6 in *Big Java*.

(Note that a snapshot of this problem has been included in the file p6.6.png)

I have provided templates for the following files:

* `Game.java`: This class should be completed by you.
* `Computer.java`: This class should be completed by you.
* `Human.java`: This class should be completed by you.

In addition to the source files for your programs include a single text file in your codio workspace named readMe.txt with an explanation of what you did for each programming problem. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met.
