ZipTest.java

ZipTest.java is the main class and communicates with Zipcode.java through lines
23 and 30 of the main. In Zipcode.java I used else if statements to convert barcodes
to digits and digits to barcodes. The else if statement was used for efficiency, 
given that it will return a digit or string as soon as a match is found. I converted
the zipcode to an array of digits in lines 85-94, starting from the right-most digit
and working backwards. I felt that working backwards would be more efficient and limit
additional steps to compute while isolating digits from the left-most point. I used if
statements in the methods to get barcode and get zipcode. If I were to do it differently,
I would add different layers of validation to block invalid entries in the main class,
such as letters or zipcodes longer than five digits. 


Nim.java

The Nim.java main communicates directly with the Game.java class through line 7 of Nim.java.
Game.java communicates with Human.java and Computer.java through line 14 and 15 of Nim.java. 
Human.java and Computer.java are self-contained and don’t rely on other classes. In Game.java 
I set the random difficulty settings to balanced, to give an equal chance for each setting in 
either smart or stupid mode before prompting the user to make a selection. In the method in 
Game.java I utilized a significant while loop to count the marbles left, indicating the computer 
or human player selection total, and ultimately declaring a winner. The Human.java move method 
includes if and else statements with a while loop to prompt the human player for a selection 
and advise on whether that selection is within the guidelines stipulated in the problem set. 
The Computer.java move method includes a boolean to indicate the number of marbles 1 less than 
a power of 2, between 0 and 100 per the instructions. The mode selected and the special numbers 
determine the computer’s ability to win the game. I used an else if loop in this section for 
algorithm efficiency.
